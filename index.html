          <p><img alt="" src="https://www.planstreetinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-is-mental-health-1024x850.png" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>

            <p></p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development.
            <br>
              <br>
            Throughout our lives, multiple individual, social and structural determinants may combine to protect or undermine our mental health and shift our position on the mental health continuum.
            <br>
             <br>
            Individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can make people more vulnerable to mental health problems.
              <br>
            <br>
            Exposure to unfavourable social, economic, geopolitical and environmental circumstances – including poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation – also increases people’s risk of experiencing mental health conditions.
            <br>
              <br>
            Risks can manifest themselves at all stages of life, but those that occur during developmentally sensitive periods, especially early childhood, are particularly detrimental. For example, harsh parenting and physical punishment is known to undermine child health and bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions.
            <br>
              <br>
            Protective factors similarly occur throughout our lives and serve to strengthen resilience. They include our individual social and emotional skills and attributes as well as positive social interactions, quality education, decent work, safe neighbourhoods and community cohesion, among others.
            <br>
              <br>
            Mental health risks and protective factors can be found in society at different scales. Local threats heighten risk for individuals, families and communities. Global threats heighten risk for whole populations and include economic downturns, disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies and forced displacement and the growing climate crisis.
            <br>
              <br>
            Each single risk and protective factor has only limited predictive strength. Most people do not develop a mental health condition despite exposure to a risk factor and many people with no known risk factor still develop a mental health condition. Nonetheless, the interacting determinants of mental health serve to enhance or undermine mental health.

            <h1>Common Issues</h1>
            <p>
                 
                <h3>Anxiety Disorders</h3>
              <p><img alt="" src="https://images.herzindagi.info/image/2023/May/how-to-cope-with-loneliness.jpg" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
                Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances. Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment in functioning. There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder and others. Effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered.
                <br><br>
                <h3>Depression</h3>
          <p><img alt="" src="https://luciadapos.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AboutYou.png" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
                Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life.  During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Several other symptoms are also present, which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling especially tired or low in energy. People with depression are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet, effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered. 
                <br><br>
                <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
          <p><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/P_culture.svg" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
                People with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with periods of manic symptoms.  During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day.  Manic symptoms may include euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour.  People with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet effective treatment options exist including psychoeducation, reduction of stress and strengthening of social functioning, and medication.
                <br><br>
                <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h3>
           <p><img alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-25-134000.png?w=657&ssl=1" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
                The prevalence of PTSD and other mental disorders is high in conflict-affected settings. PTSD may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all of the following: 
              <br>
                <br>1) Re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present (intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares)
              <br>
                <br>2) Avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event, or avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event.
              <br>  
              <br>3) Persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. These symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in functioning. Effective psychological treatment exists. 
                <br><br> 
                <h3>Schizophrenia</h3>
          <p><img alt="" src="https://neuropedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sdf-450x400.jpg" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
                People with schizophrenia have a life expectancy 10-20 years below that of the general population. Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in perception and changes in behaviour. Symptoms may include persistent delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, highly disorganised behaviour, or extreme agitation. People with schizophrenia may experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive functioning. Yet, a range of effective treatment options exist, including medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, and psychosocial rehabilitation.  
                <br><br>
                <h3>Eating Disorders</h3>
          <p><img alt="" src="https://mycompass.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/eating-disorder.png" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
                Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, involve abnormal eating and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape concerns. The symptoms or behaviours result in significant risk or damage to health, significant distress, or significant impairment of functioning. Anorexia nervosa often has its onset during adolescence or early adulthood and is associated with premature death due to medical complications or suicide.  Individuals with bulimia nervosa are at a significantly increased risk for substance use, suicidality, and health complications. Effective treatment options exist, including family-based treatment and cognitive-based therapy.

            <h2>Self Care</h2>
            <p>
              <p>
               
              <h6>Self-care means taking the time to do things that help you live well and improve both your physical health and mental health. When it comes to your mental health, self-care can help you manage stress, lower your risk of illness, and increase your energy. Even small acts of self-care in your daily life can have a big impact.</h6>
              <br>

Here are some tips to help you get started with self-care:
<br>

<h4>1) Get regular exercise. </h4>
                 <p><img alt="" src="https://www.southdevon.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sports-and-Fitness-Adult-12-scaled.jpg" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
              Just 30 minutes of walking every day can help boost your mood and improve your health. Small amounts of exercise add up, so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do 30 minutes at one time.
<br>
              <br>
              <h4>2) Eat healthy, regular meals and stay hydrated.</h4>
           <p><img alt="" src="https://www.eatingwell.com/thmb/C6V5vgk4RTajGbz-vSxta8QoA6E=/400x262/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/How-Eating-More-Fiber-Could-Lower-Arthritis-Risk-According-to-New-Research-0e09b3ba67514d45aeba0576808ecf3d.jpg" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
              A balanced diet and plenty of water can improve your energy and focus throughout the day. Also, limit caffeinated beverages such as soft drinks or coffee.
    <br>
              <br>
<h4>3) Make sleep a priority.</h4> 
          <p><img alt="" src="https://img.livestrong.com/1260x/clsd/getty/b54fd56266b641779173da80dcc3ebce.jpg?type=webp" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
              Stick to a schedule, and make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Blue light from devices and screens can make it harder to fall asleep, so reduce blue light exposure from your phone or computer before bedtime.
<br>
              <br>
              <h4>4) Try a relaxing activity. </h4>
           <p><img alt="" src="https://img.livestrong.com/1260x/cme-data/getty%2Fd3263a7b0b184b778db5cc9122ca63ad.jpg?type=webp" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
              Explore relaxation or wellness programs or apps, which may incorporate meditation, muscle relaxation, or breathing exercises. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy activities you enjoy such as journaling.
              <br>
              <br>

<h4>5) Stay connected. </h4>
          <p><img alt="" src="https://img.livestrong.com/1260x/cme-data/getty%2Fd6765a28e51b48be99d15bf15d419bc1.jpg?type=webp" style="height:150px; width:180" /></p>
          Reach out to your friends or family members who can provide emotional support and practical  
help.
